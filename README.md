# ai2-login-page
<hr>
This is a sample simple login page using MIT App inventor (ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)<br>

I used app inventor to do front and back end programming, and simple PHP programming to pass data from and to the database<br>
i put the php file in one server with the database, so if your hosting support localhost use it instead the others for db connection<br>
